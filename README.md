# Hello / Dia dhuit

I love Python and BPMN tools (workflow/modeling). Trying to find the time to learn Go and Vue. My bearla is better than my gaelige.

Feel free to help or fork anything.

## Current Projects
- TestAPI: A FastAPI project to learn and use for basic ideas
- Starlette Dashboard: A Starlette starter project.
- DevTools: Built with Starlette. I want to build a tools site to help a bunch of common work items. Based off Starlette Dashboard.
- DevSetGo_Lib: PyPi package I use for common functions
